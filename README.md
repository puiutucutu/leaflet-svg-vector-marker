# leaflet-svg-vector-marker
Addon to Leaflet that allows you to create custom markers by providing svg properties

## Description

With so many open source SVG icons out there, it's a shame to have to rigidly be stuck with importing icons from an entire library like font-awesome or bootstrap icons when you might want to mix and match a few custom svg icons.

## Accepted SVG Input Config

- JSON string pattern (paths and viewbox params)
  * `pin.paths: ["M499..", "M172..."]` & `pin.viewbox: "0 0 384 512"`
- Preloaded SVG icons
